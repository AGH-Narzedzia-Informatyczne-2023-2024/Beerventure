# Beerventure
A roguelike centered around the best beverage humanity ever created. It's a 2D game based on classic principles: exploring an endless dungeon, fighting enormous waves containg various types of enemies and seeking the most favourable attacks' upgreades. However it's based on a subject quite unusual but very familiar to us, undergratuates: beer. It's graphic will mostly be in pixelart style and it's being developed using Python.

## Gameplay

### Combat
The player can damage the enemies using one of three types of attacks:
- The **Slash** (**Szarża Żubra**) - damage groups of opponents standing directly in your path. (BASE ATTACK)
- The **Spin** (**Okołocim**) - great for dealing with opponents coming from multiple directions at the same time.
- The **Bomb** (**Łap Harnasia**) - throw a beer bomb to eliminate your opponents from a safe distance.

### Enemies
- **Moiras of intoxication** - spawn in groups of three. They are small, but fast, gremlin-looking and extremely annoying. Their main form of attack is waves that slow a player down due to massive hangover. They're common and easy to defeat. 
- **Teetotaller** - very serious, looks like this one corporate rat. Its main advantage is being resistant to most types of beer. It attacks with disadvantages of beer (diseases etcetera). Drops vodka.
#### Bosses
- **Papa Vodka** - the belarussian equivalent of Santa Claus, except drunk and gifting Vodka instead of gifts. For those beerdrinkers naughty enough, he inflicts them with their worst nightmare, being fully surrounded by vodka not being able to move. Drops potato.
- **Dionysus** - god of wine (main opponent of beer). In opposition to archetype, it's quite sophisticated-looking. Likes huge, empty spaces. Drops grape.
- **Bourbonchaun** - a scheming gnome, who took a wrong turn in his life now keeping bourbon at the end of the rainbow instead of his gold. Ironically his main weapon is his prefered drink, which after an attack remain on the ground for some time. Drops lucky clover.
- **Bagpipe** - a scotish lad, only wanting 2 things from life. To play his bagpipes and to drink whisky. Whenever attacking he leaves a trail of his drink of choice in the direction of his attack

### Upgrades
As for now player can acquire buffs in form of beer from slain enemies. We plan to add various type of beers that grant player AMAZING effects. After slaying a boss you will get special upgrade that differ from other normal upgrades. It effects could be game-changing.

### Progress
The game's goal is to survive for 10 minutes. Every two and a half minutes a boss spawns, thus pausing the timer. After its the defeat the boss drops an additional upgrade for the player to collect. Every minute and fifteen seconds the enemies grow stronger, however granting slightly more XP. After collecting enough XP, the player will be enabled to upgrade their attack, HP, attack speed and/or more.
